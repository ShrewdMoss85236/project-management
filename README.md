🏢 Employee Management and Payroll System

📚 About the Project
This is a comprehensive Employee Management and Payroll System designed to streamline the management of employee data, attendance tracking, and payroll calculation. The system is ideal for small and medium-sized businesses looking to automate their HR and payroll processes efficiently.

🎯 Key Features
Employee Database: Store and manage detailed information about employees, including personal details, job roles, and contact information.
Attendance Tracking: Record daily attendance and track working hours or overtime for each employee.
Payroll Calculation: Automatically calculate salaries based on working hours, overtime, tax deductions, and bonuses.
Role-Based Access Control: Secure system access with different levels of permissions for administrators and employees.
Reporting: Generate detailed reports for payroll, attendance, and employee performance.

⚙️ Technology Stack
Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or frameworks like React for advanced UI).
Backend: Powered by Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js for API management.
Database: Uses SQL Server or MySQL for storing employee and payroll data.
Optional Tools:
Excel/CSV Integration: For importing/exporting employee data.
Docker: For containerized deployment.

🚀 How It Works
Employee Management: HR/admin can add, update, or remove employee details through an intuitive dashboard.
Attendance Tracking: Employees mark attendance daily, which is recorded in the database.
Payroll Calculation: The system automatically calculates salaries based on pre-configured rules (e.g., base salary, tax deductions, overtime rates).
Report Generation: The system generates monthly payroll slips and attendance summaries for HR and employees.

💡 Future Enhancements
Integration with Biometric Devices: Automate attendance tracking through fingerprint or RFID scanners.
Tax Compliance Updates: Automatically apply updates to tax rules based on local government regulations.
Mobile App: Develop a mobile-friendly version for employees to access pay slips and track attendance.
Cloud Deployment: Host the system on AWS/GCP for scalability and remote access.
